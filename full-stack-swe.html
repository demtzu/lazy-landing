                          <!-- Intro -->

                                <div class="text-left mt-32 mrl-50 text-sm">Can you remember the first time you felt the superpower of using a CLI?</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">We want to bring this delightful experience - that engineers enjoy daily - to everyone.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">CLIs can feel like a black box for non-technical people and thus were never adopted widely because of their learning curve.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">But at Lazy we believe that we can reunify the experience of a CLI with a classical GUI to build what we call a CLUI: an interface with a small learning curve that blends GUIs and CLIs to perform actions in the quickest and most intuitive way possible.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">Today CLIs are back, but hidden under the name of search and we think it's the perfect time to put the spotlight on all the efficiency of the original CLIs.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">With that in mind, we launched the first version of Lazy and became the IoT <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lazy"><u>Product of the Year 2019</u></a> on Product Hunt.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">We're now applying that same UX paradigm to the world of thoughts and tasks: the next level of Lazy is a smart CLUI that captures a thought with its context at the speed of a keyboard shortcut.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">Often when you are in the middle of something, a thought comes to mind that you need to write down, whether it's a lightbulb moment or a reminder. With Lazy, you can write down that thought with a UX that reduces the cognitive cost of jotting something down, respecting your precious flow, and always designed for speed.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">We believe that CLUI is the perfect tool to capture anything from anywhere but unfortunately that won’t help users think better or get more done unless there is a good system behind to process those thoughts. That's why we're also building what we call a <i>Universal Inbox</i> to collect all your captures.</div>
                            </div>

                        <img src="/assets/images/lazy-scope-capture.png">

                        <div class="text-left mt-32 mrl-50 text-sm">These different workflows make us rethink productivity from the first principle and it brings a wide range of technical challenges. We need remarkable engineering to pull it off. As a member of our small team, you’ll have a massive impact and plenty of opportunities to both leverage your existing strengths and learn new skills.</div>

                        <!-- What You'll Do -->

                        <h3 class="section-title text-left">What You'll Do</h3>

                        <ul class="text-sm">
                          <li class="lili">You'll first build the core features of our MVP closely with our CTO from start to finish by breaking down high-level goals into tasks and timelines.</li>
                          <li class="lili">You'll then take ownership of the features that you develop — think features to improve the format of captures that we support, such as a tweet storm captured in a neat way into the <i>universal inbox.</i></li>
                          <li class="lili">You'll build improvements to performance, reliability and product polish, making the Lazy infrastructure scalable and monitoring end-user experience.</li>
                          <li class="lili">You'll make every interaction faster than 100ms because it is the threshold where interactions feel instantaneous.</li>
                          <li class="lili">You'll take the lead on important subjects such as the text editor stream.</li>
                          <li class="lili">Long term, you'll help to mentor, coach and support a future engineering team. You'll be involved with recruiting and interviewing talented engineers.</li>
                          <li class="lili">Technologies we use:  React, Redux, Electron, REST API, Docker, Heroku</li>

                        <div class="text-left mt-32 mrl-50 text-sm">We care deeply about design — for us a great productivity software is in fact a wellness product, it's all about how it works and how it looks. It should spark joy and feel like a garden where our digital life seamlessly takes place. At its core, Lazy is a software where speed, interaction, and small details matter. We are designing it to be highly functional, yet minimalistic and delightful.</div>
