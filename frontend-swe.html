                          <!-- Intro -->

                                <div class="text-left mt-32 mrl-50 text-sm">Can you remember the first time you felt the superpower of using a CLI?</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">We want to bring this delightful experience - that engineers enjoy daily - to everyone.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">CLIs can feel like a black box for non-technical people and thus were never adopted widely because of their learning curve.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">But at Lazy we believe that we can reunify the experience of a CLI with a classical GUI to build what we call a CLUI: an interface with a small learning curve that blends GUIs and CLIs to perform actions in the quickest and most intuitive way possible.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">Today CLIs are back, but hidden under the name of search and we think it's the perfect time to put the spotlight on all the efficiency of the original CLIs.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">With that in mind, we launched the first version of Lazy and became the IoT <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/lazy"><u>Product of the Year 2019</u></a> on Product Hunt.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">We're now applying that same UX paradigm to the world of thoughts and tasks: the next level of Lazy is a smart CLUI that captures a thought with its context at the speed of a keyboard shortcut.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">Often when you are in the middle of something, a thought comes to mind that you need to write down, whether it's a lightbulb moment or a reminder. With Lazy, you can write down that thought with a UX that reduces the cognitive cost of jotting something down, respecting your precious flow, and always designed for speed.</div>

                                <div class="text-left mt-8 mrl-50 text-sm">We believe that CLUI is the perfect tool to capture anything from anywhere but unfortunately that won’t help users think better or get more done unless there is a good system behind to process those thoughts. That's why we're also building what we call a <i>Universal Inbox</i> to collect all your captures.</div>
                            </div>

                        <img src="/assets/images/lazy-scope-capture.png">

                        <div class="text-left mt-32 mrl-50 text-sm">These different workflows make us rethink productivity from the first principle and it brings a wide range of technical challenges. We need remarkable engineering to pull it off. As a member of our founding team, you’ll have a massive impact and plenty of opportunities to both leverage your existing strengths and learn new skills.</div>
